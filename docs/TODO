BOOK FORMATS

- MOBI/AZW/PRC files imported directly into the library may have other ASIN set in their EXTH field, or no ASIN at all
	Solution: convert the file to MOBI in Calibre, it will set the ASIN/Title/Author fields to the proper value.

- HTML, TXT, CBZ: not working properly -- the kindle downloads them, but does not see them as 'ebooks'
    Plus they show in the books list with ugly filenames.

Conclusion: KSP only works properly with MOBI files generated by Calibre, and PDFs.


EXTRA FEATURES

- (?) intercept the kindle store calls and provide info pages for books
	there's a lot of work to do to implement the full kindle store pages
