- !!! DOCUMENTATION !!!


SECURITY

- support SSL directly in KSP


BOOK FORMATS

- MOBI/AZW/PRC files imported directly into the library may have other ASIN set in their EXTH field, or no ASIN at all
	Solution: convert the file to MOBI in Calibre, it will set the ASIN/Title/Author fields to the proper value.

- PDF: files need to have some extra metadata for the Kindle to see them as PDOCs
	DON'T re-convert to PDF in Calibre, the result will be ugly (literally).

- TXT: not working at all right now; files send to Amazon's Personal Documents get converted to AZW to get them working on the Kindle

Conclusion: KSP only works properly with MOBI files generated by Calibre.


EXTRA FEATURES

- sidecar support: while the kindle uploads sidecar data for all books, downloading them works only for Amazon's books
	not sure which features can be implemented
		page numbers (APNX) should be downloadable from calibre
		notes & highlighs for MOBI
		last-read position
	would have to figure out MBP format -- it's quite opaque and there may be not enough info to generate it
		(http://www.angelfire.com/ego2/idleloop/mbp_reader.html#mbp_file_format) -- angelfire is still alive?
	would also require writing in the calibre db, and if calibre is running, the results are unpredictable
- (?) intercept the kindle store calls and provide info pages for books
	there's a lot of work to do to implement the full kindle store pages


TOOLING

- (?) Script for updating the ServerConfig.conf file, so people don't have to edit it by hand and then deploy it.
- (?) Would it be possible to make a kindlet to do the ServerConfig.conf editing on-the-device?  Would it be useful?
- (?) cacerts importer (keytool equivalent) that would run on the Kindle.
