Generated collections
---------------------

KSP can generate collections based on the books' series and tags.

To use them, you need to import these collections into your device.

Go to [MENU] -> View Archived Items -> Add Other Device Collections.
You will see a device called 'Calibre Library' -- it's a bogus device, it's record generated by KSP.

Import the collections from the 'Calibre Library' device.

For each book series, a new collection will be created on the device.

For each configured tag (in etc/features.py:collection_tags), a new collection named '{*tag_name*}' will be created on the device.
If no books (with files!) have a given tag, that collection will *not* be created on your device.

The generated collections will contain all the matching books in your Calibre library, whether you have them downloaded onto your device or not.

If you later add more books into a series, give them a configured tag, you can just re-import the collections from the 'Calibre Library' device.
