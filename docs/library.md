Calibre library management
==========================

KSP will continuously monitor the Calibre database file for changes.  If you
add books, update a book's metadata, or re-generate its MOBI files, these
changes *should* be visible on your device at the next sync, in the _Archived
Items_ section.


Restrictions
------------

Right now, KSP only works with MOBI (AZW/PRC) books in your Calibre library.

These files *must* also have the correct ASIN (book id) metadata embedded in
them. MOBI files generated by Calibre always have the corect ASIN. If you
import MOBI books into your Calibre library, you *must* re-convert them to
MOBI (the original file will be kept, as *book_name*.ORIGINAL_MOBI).

The up-side is, the integration with Calibre *should* be seamless. If you
connect the Kindle with an USB cable to the machine, and let Calibre see it,
it will see the books -- downloaded through KSP -- from its library as being
on the device.


Generated collections
---------------------

KSP can generate collections based on the books' series and tags.  To use
them, you need to import these collections into your device.

Go to [MENU] -> _View Archived Items_ -> _Add Other Device Collections_. You
will see a device called _Calibre Library_ -- it's a bogus device, it's record
generated by KSP.

After importing the collections from the 'Calibre Library' device:

* for each book series, a new collection will be created on the device * for
each configured tag (in etc/features.py:collection_tags), a new collection
named '{*tag_name*}' will be created on the device. If no books (with valid
files!) have a given tag, that collection will *not* be created on your
device.

The generated collections will contain all the matching books in your Calibre
library, whether you have them downloaded onto your device or not.

If you later add more books into a series, or give them a configured tag, you
can just re-import the collections from the bogus _Calibre Library_ device.


Book updates
------------

If the download_updated_books option is set in etc/features.py, updating
book files for a book on your device (downloaded through KSP!), will cause
the Kindle device to download the new version.

**WARNING** A side-effect is that you will lose the last-read-position, and
any notes and highlights on that book! Basically the Kindle will behave as if
the book has just been downloaded for the first time.


Notes & Highlights
------------------

At this moment, KSP does **not** back-up the last-read-position, notes and
highlights for books downloaded throught it. This means that if you delete the
book from the device, you will lose this information -- though the notes &
hightlight may still be kept in the 'My Clippings' file on the device.
