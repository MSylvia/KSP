Configuring the devices to use KSP
====================================


WARNING
-------

KSP has only been tested on a **Kindle 4 (Non-Touch)**, software version **4.0.1**. Sorry, it's the only device I have
to test it with. The scripts have been tested only on a Kindle4NT; on other devices they will, in a best-case scenario,
not work.

KSP _may_ work with Kindle 3 (aka Kindle Keyboard). The configuration steps detailed here are most likely wrong, so **do
not** follow them. They also may be close enough, so if you know what you're doing the sections below might give you an
idea of what you need to do.

KSP _may_ also be made to work with Kindle Touch, but **do not** follow the instructions here -- they will almost
guarantee briking it. You'll have to do the configuration by hand, if configuring a Touch is possible at all.

If you have an usupported device, continue reading for details on what configuration changes are necessary. Maybe you'll
figure out what you need to do on your device. And if you do, please let me know :).

Before changing your device configuration, you need to have KSP deployed and running. Please read `docs/install.md` for
instructions.


Kindle devices
--------------

KSP is being developed and has been extensively tested to work with the Kindle 4 device. See `docs/device-kindle-4.md`
for details on configuring a Kindle 4 to talk to KSP.


Desktop clients
---------------

KSP also supports the Kindle for PC client, and has been tested with version 1.9+. See `docs/device-kindle-pc.md` for
details on configuring it to talk to KSP.
